## 🎯 Purpose
This repository demonstrates practical Domain-Driven Design applied to a pharmacy insurance claim system.

## 📋 Business Domain
Processing pharmacy insurance claims involves:
- Patient submits prescription with insurance info

1. **Event Storming** - Collaborative workshop
2. **Bounded Contexts** - Clear boundaries
3. **Context Mapping** - How contexts communicate
4. **Ubiquitous Language** - Shared vocabulary

### Tactical Design
1. **Aggregates** - Transaction boundaries
2. **Value Objects** - Immutable objects
3. **Domain Events** - Meaningful domain events
4. **Domain Services** - Stateless operations
